# Substance Abuse Data Analysis Project
This independent data analysis project aims to answer the fundamental question - who needs aid within the current context of the opioid epidemic that is sweeping the United States? Substance abuse is an important public health issue, and one of the first steps to addressing this increasingly prevalent issue is determining which populations are most at-risk and need more support.

Through statistical modeling (more specifically, multiple logistic regression models), we can infer via estimated odds ratios that the following two populations need more support:
  - people with co-occuring mental health and substance abuse issues, and
  - houseless people

Note that there are future considerations and potential limitations of this project, which are all discussed in detail.
